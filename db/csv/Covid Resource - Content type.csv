The tool contains an interactive map with CART tree analysis."
65,https://www.unescap.org/resources/leave-no-one-behind-decision-tree-user-reference-guide,Classification and Regression Trees (CART): A User Reference Guide for Identifying Those Left Furthest Behind,"The Covid-19 pandemic has aggravated existing inequalities whilst creating new vulnerabilities within societies in Asia and the Pacific. This user reference guide elaborates on the methodologies behind the process to identify those furthest behind using Classification and Regression Trees (CART), with explanations on how these methodologies can be modelled to assess the preparedness against Covid-19 pandemic, and how those results should be interpreted. The identification of those furthest behind could help policy makers to tailor social protection responses to those most vulnerable to contracting the virus to shield them from shocks and life contingencies inflicted by the Covid-19 pandemic."
66,https://www.unescap.org/covid19/policy-responses,Policy Responses to COVID-19 in Asia and the Pacific,"This online visualization tool explores how governments in the Asia-Pacific region are taking administrative and policy actions to cope with COVID-19 pandemic and its adverse impacts. Most countries and territories have adopted travel restrictions and social distancing policies to slow the spread of the disease. While many countries have rolled out fiscal and monetary stimulus packages, their scale and policy focus differ depending on their national circumstances, implementation capacities and how severely they have been affected by COVID-19 disease. In going forward, the region needs to invest in health and social protection systems and embed long-term sustainability into stimulus packages and recovery policies in order to strengthen resilience to future shocks. Policy coordination across countries is critical to ensure that no one is left behind."

Just as during the 2008 global financial crisis, the world is looking right now at Asia and the Pacific to lift the global economy out of the current recession. At this critical crossroads, the region should transform itself from being an economic growth leader into a trailblazer for sustainable development."
68,https://www.ilo.org/asia/publications/WCMS_753550/lang--en/index.htm,Social protection responses to COVID-19 in Asia and the Pacific: The story so far and future considerations,"Governments in the Asia Pacific region have taken unprecedented measures to respond to the health, economic and social impacts of the crisis. Temporary social protection measures have played a prominent role. The crisis has provided a wake-up call to the significant gaps in coverage and adequacy of existing social protection systems, and dramatically increased the visibility to policy makers of those left behind. Such systems have the potential to form a core component of wider recovery plans that seek not only to provide relief but influence a path to more sustainable and equitable economic and social development."
