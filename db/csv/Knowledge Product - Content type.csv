9,0,Social outlook for Asia and the Pacific : poorly protected,"The Social Outlook for Asia and the Pacific lays out new arguments and evidence for the critical and urgent need to increase investment in people, particularly in social protection. Developing countries in Asia and the Pacific only spend about 3.7 per cent of GDP on social protection, compared to the world average of 11.2 per cent. This under investment is the reason why 60 per cent of the population in the Asia-Pacific region has no protection if they fall ill, have a disability, become unemployed, pregnant or old. With 1.2 billion people living on than less $3.20 per day, of which 400 million live on less than $1.9 per day, social protection is an essential strategy to tackle poverty and deprivation. The evidence for increasing the level of investment in people in Asia and the Pacific is overwhelming: around 328 million people would be lifted out of moderate poverty and 52 million would move out of extreme poverty, if countries in the region matched the global averages of spending on education, health and social protection. Countries in the region do not have to wait to become rich to start investing in people. Even low income and lower-middle income countries can boost social spending, as evidenced by some first movers across the region.",1,2018-01-01,101,102,103,104,105,0,0,0,0,301,401,https://repository.unescap.org/handle/20.500.12870/1567,1001,"• <b>Chapter 1</b>: Poverty remains a challenge

14,0,Inequality in Asia and the Pacific in the era of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development,"Inequality in Asia and the Pacific is on the rise. Many countries, including those held up as models of dynamism and prosperity, have experienced a widening of existing gaps, accompanied by environmental degradation. Market-led growth alone is not sufficient to deliver a prosperous, sustainable future for all.

This report takes a novel approach by focusing on multiple aspects of inequality – inequality of outcomes, of opportunities and of impacts. It also pays special attention to the potentially transformative role of technology and the impact that the incipient Fourth Industrial Revolution may have on inequality.

The report finds that unequal access to basic opportunities has left large groups of people behind and contributed to widening inequalities of outcomes, particularly in income and wealth. In turn, these inequalities have aggravated inequalities in access to health care, education, technology, and protection from natural disasters and environmental hazards – creating hardship for communities and families over generations.

Written against the backdrop of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its pledge to “leave no one behind”, the report analyses the consequences inequality has on countries, communities and people across the Asia-Pacific region. Drawing on a wide range of data sources, backed up with evidence-based studies, it examines the drivers of inequality and identifies groups of people that are most likely to be left behind. It presents a convincing case for reducing inequality and puts forward an eight-point policy agenda for shaping a more inclusive, prosperous and sustainable future for all.",1,2018-01-01,101,108,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,301,403,https://repository.unescap.org/handle/20.500.12870/1551,1002,"• <b>Chapter 1</b>: Inequality of Outcomes in Asia and the Pacific: Trends, Drivers and Costs

24,0,Sustainable Social Development in Asia and the Pacific: Towards a People-Centred Transformation,"The Asia-Pacific region’s impressive economic growth and remarkable achievements in poverty reduction have not succeeded in closing gaps in income between the rich and poor, nor the unequal access to, for example, health care and education among other basic services. These gaps disproportionately affect women and the most vulnerable segments of society. They also hamper inclusive growth, undermine social cohesion and contribute to unsustainable production and consumption patterns. In short, these social development gaps undermine efforts to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Sustainable Social Development in Asia and the Pacific summarizes the social development gaps as countries in the region take steps to achieve the SDGs, and sketches out a broad regional agenda for a people-centred transformation, outlining some of the key priorities and resources needed. The policy simulations reported here clearly indicate that acceleration of economic growth alone would not address the remaining development gaps. Changing the development paradigm to ensure more decent jobs, complemented by broadened coverage of social protection and universal education and health care is critical for eliminating extreme poverty from the region and achieving the other SDGs.

Since its establishment in 1947, ESCAP has promoted social protection as part of an overall strategy of reducing inequality, particularly addressing the exclusion of the most vulnerable groups, and offering a path out of poverty and dependence.

This report explores the linkages between inequality and social protection. Overall, it argues that inequality, in its multiple forms, is on the rise in Asia and the Pacific, and that this is having an adverse impact on sustainable development. The report provides evidence that social protection is an effective instrument to reduce inequalities, and, by so doing, contributes to the integration of the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development.

This report, prepared as the theme study for the 75th Commission Session, gages recent progress towards equality in three key outcomes: education, full-time employment and income.

Covering the past ten years, the report assesses whether women, rural populations, persons with disabilities and other disadvantaged groups have fallen further behind, been included in overall national development gains, or empowered to catch up with outcome levels of more privileged groups.

The report builds its narrative on quantifying progress in inclusion and empowerment by measuring how gaps between disadvantaged and advantaged groups have changed over time. It finds encouraging signs of empowerment in education, but such developments are often eclipsed by less widespread improvements in full-time employment. The picture that transpires is one where disadvantaged groups, in several countries, have benefited from broader economic growth and societal progress, while advantaged groups have been in the driver’s seat.

These crises reflect the increased risks associated with globalization, especially for the poor and those without voice. In addition, several countries in Asia and the Pacific have been profoundly affected by high-impact natural disasters which have exposed vulnerabilities and amplified the insecurities of many people’s livelihoods. This has especially been the case for poor households located in rural areas. Such crises and development challenges have generated renewed interest in social protection as a tool to mitigate not only the impacts of shocks but also to help accelerate the recovery of people most affected by such events.

Much of this interest has focused on the risks and vulnerabilities that have emerged as a result of specific events and, consequently, social protection initiatives have tended to be reactive rather than proactive. Yet, it is also known that poverty and exclusion magnify the effects of crises, and so to be truly effective and transformative social protection must be linked to efforts to reduce poverty and exclusion and in so doing eliminate the structures that place people in situations of vulnerability in the first place.

This report provides a compelling argument for advancing the social protection agenda in Asia and the Pacific along this direction.",1,2011-01-01,101,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,301,0,https://repository.unescap.org/handle/20.500.12870/1582,0,,,,https://repository.unescap.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12870/1582/ESCAP-2011-FS-promise-of-protection.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y

The action plan serves as guiding document for ESCAP member States to agree on a regional shared vision, strategy and platform on social protection.

58,0,Action plan to strengthen regional cooperation on social protection in Asia and the Pacific (Background Document),"Never before has the need for social protection been greater. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has accentuated the central role that social protection plays in building resilience and mitigating risks for individuals, households and society at large. The crisis has also highlighted the importance of social protection schemes that cover everyone throughout their lives.

Social protection is one of the core national strategies for preventing poverty and vulnerability and also serves as an enabler for implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and achieving target 1.3 of the Sustainable Development Goals.Recognizing its importance as both a fundamental right and an effective mechanism for promoting sustainable development, many countries in Asia and the Pacific are increasing their efforts to broaden social protection coverage.

Nevertheless, the region’s investment in social protection is lower than the global average, resulting in 60 per cent of the population remaining vulnerable to ordinary contingencies throughout their lives, such as sickness, unemployment, disability, pregnancy and old age.

The Committee on Social Development, at its fifth session, convened from 28 to 30 November 2018, recommended strengthening regional cooperation on social protection through the establishment of a regional modality. In response, the secretariat has worked with experts nominated by member States to develop an action plan to strengthen regional cooperation on social protection in Asia and the Pacific, contained in the present document.

The draft action plan was submitted to the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific for endorsement at its seventy-sixth session, but the Commission requested the Committee at its sixth session to review the action plan with a view to providing advice on the follow-up, as appropriate. In this regard, the Committee may wish to review the action plan with a view to endorsing it. ",2,2020-01-01,101,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,301,0,,1004,"• Introduction

60,7,How to Design Inclusive Old Age Pension Systems in Asia and the Pacific,"Pension schemes protect older persons and their families facing barriers to earning an income in old age, as well as potential increases in health and other expenditures. While many people in the Asian and Pacific region continue to work into old age, labour force participation and earnings decrease at older ages. This is strongly linked to higher levels of disability and decreasing health in old age. It is related to factors such as age and gender discrimination in the workplace, legal restrictions, mandatory retirement age and cultural norms. Women are also more likely than men to be without income in old age. Disability and ill health not only create challenges for accessing paid work, but contribute to higher costs for older persons, including costs of accessing health care and personal assistance. While cultural traditions of family support to older persons have been historically strong in the region, the support provided is often insufficient, and providing this support puts pressure on household finances and employment prospects, particularly for women.",2,2022-01-01,101,0,0,0,0,0,501,503,510,301,404,https://repository.unescap.org/handle/20.500.12870/4371,1003,"• The role of inclusive old age pension systems in an ageing Asia and the Pacific\

70,0,Active labour market policies in Asia and the Pacific : a review of the literature,"This paper reviews the evidence on the effectiveness of active labour market programmes in low- and middle-income countries with high informality, highlighting examples of interventions that have been implemented in combination with other policies including social protection measures. In reviewing the literature, we adopt a scoping review methodology to identify studies that look at a range of programme outcomes including earnings, employment, formality and productivity. We include studies from 2000 onwards, and after a thorough selection and screening process we end up with 106 papers for the review. Most of these studies find some positive aspect associated with the programme under study, although significant positive aspects are in many cases contingent on a specific target population, or time frame of programme and evaluation. We employ a theory of change conceptual framework to further discuss the channels, mechanisms and assumptions that are seen to underpin programme effectiveness (or the lack of).

71,0,Steps to Inclusive Social Protection Systems,"Governments have increasingly recognized social protection as a key policy instrument to build a more productive, protected and healthy population in Asia and the Pacific. In 2020, ESCAP member States endorsed the regional ESCAP Action Plan to Strengthen Regional Cooperation on Social Protection in Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP Action Plan), which serves as a shared vision, strategy and platform for promoting partnership and peer learning and identifying needs for capacity development. At the national level, the ESCAP Action Plan calls on countries to establish an intermediate target of social protection coverage by 2025, and then measure progress towards achieving universal coverage by 2030. To achieve this objective, the ESCAP Action Plan lays out 12 measures to be taken at the national level.

Social protection has been identified as an enabler for implementing the 2030 Agenda. To achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and deliver on the commitments contained therein, most countries in the region need to step up their efforts to build sustainable and reliable social protection systems. For this purpose, the ESCAP Action Plan and its national actions will be helpful for countries in furthering their inclusive social protection agenda.

To support member States in the implementation of this first ever regional Action Plan, ESCAP has been mandated to develop a regional platform to facilitate peer learning and enhance the knowledge and awareness of member States to implement the ESCAP Action Plan.

The Steps to Inclusive Social Protection Systems sets out 12 milestones for developing an integrated and sustainable social protection system, aligned with the ESCAP Action Plan,1 that has the buy-in of key actors, guarantees the right to social protection for all, addresses gaps in current social protection systems, identifies solutions to support sustainable financing, removes inefficiencies and fragmentation in delivery and administration, and responds to shocks more efficiently and effectively.",2,2022-08-29,101,108,110,107,0,0,503,510,0,0,0,https://repository.unescap.org/handle/20.500.12870/4724,1004,"• ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

72,0,Towards universal social protection,"Universality, or the achievement of universal social protection, has been endorsed by the
international community and in the region as a key objective of social protection. Solidarity
and trust in public systems, including through universal social protection, will underpin the
advancement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. However, understanding
often remains unclear around what universality entails in terms of systems, schemes,
combinations of non-contributory and contributory benefits, and eligibility.

This paper aims to build understanding of the underlying concepts around universality
through first providing a brief trajectory of universality in section 2, before exploring why
universal coverage must be achieved in section 3. In section 4 the paper looks at the key
lifecycle and labour market contingencies that should be covered while section 5 provides a
simplified definition of universality. Section 6 then explores ways forward to achieve
universality through a single scheme or multiple schemes. Section 7 provides options to move
toward progressively achieving universal coverage within contexts of limited fiscal space.
Finally, section 8 discusses the important linkages between universality and the social
contract. ",0,2022-07-01,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,1006,"• Acknowledgements

76,0,Inequality of opportunity in Asia and the Pacific : pandemic preparedness,"Pandemics have constituted challenging and recurrent episodes of humankind history. Major pandemics such as plagues, cholera, smallpox, tuberculosis and influenza have afflicted the health and well-being of millions, bringing societies and economies to their knees. The world is still grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. As of April 25, 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) had confirmed over 500 million positive cases and over 6 million deaths worldwide. While most infected by COVID-19 do recover, many will suffer long-term consequences, such as fatigue, fever, tiredness and depression. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has been a major shock to economic and social progress in Asia and the Pacific. By exacerbating existing inequalities of income and access to basic services and opportunities, the pandemic could reverse decades of hard-won gains by pushing millions back into poverty. Its far-reaching health and economic consequences are still unfolding. Poorer individuals, migrants, informal workers, less educated groups, women, children and the youth, are more likely to contract the virus because of living and working conditions that limit their ability to protect themselves from the disease. At the same time, the health consequences of the disease are felt by all, particularly older persons and those suffering from chronic or long-term health conditions.

The economic costs of the COVID-19 pandemic have been high. During 2020, the Asia-Pacific region experienced a GDP contraction of 1.1 per cent. Disruptions in economic activity are estimated to have pushed 75-80 million people back into extreme poverty. The years 2021–2022, however, proved to be even more challenging as the highly contagious Delta and Omicron variants resulted in further lockdowns and continued travel bans. The situation was aggravated by the slow progress of vaccination rollouts.

As COVID-19 is turning endemic, it is time to reflect on how to better prepare for future similar threats. In addition to national public health responses and global detection and coordination efforts, much of the preparation can be done at the household level. Understanding and addressing inequalities in access to basic services.",2,2022-06-01,101,108,0,0,0,0,501,503,517,301,402,https://repository.unescap.org/handle/20.500.12870/4615,1007,"• Acknowledgements

77,0,Inequality of opportunity on Asia and the Pacific : financial inclusion 2022 update,"The ESCAP nequality of Opportunity papers place men and women at the heart of sustainable and inclusive development. They do so by identifying areas where inequality jeopardizes a person’s prospects, namely: education; women’s access to sexual and reproductive health care; children’s nutrition; decent work; basic water and sanitation; access to clean energy; and financial inclusion. Each of these opportunities is covered by specific commitments outlined in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and addressed in separate thematic reports covering 27 countries throughout Asia and the Pacific.

ESCAP first discussed inequality of opportunity in its 2015 report Time for Equality, establishing the distinction between inequality of outcome and inequality of opportunity. While the former depicts the consequences of unequally distributed income and wealth, the latter is concerned with access to key services necessary to fulfil one’s basic rights.The Inequality of Opportunity papers apply a novel approach to analysing household surveys with the aim of identifying the groups of individuals with the lowest access to the above-referenced opportunities. These groups are defined by common circumstances over which the individual has no direct control, such as their wealth, place of residence and education level, amongst others. 

In addition to identifying the furthest behind, the Inequality of Opportunity papers also explore the gaps between groups in accessing these key opportunities, as well as the extent to which these have narrowed or widened over time. They also review overall inequality trends in these opportunities.

Ultimately, these findings are of direct use for generating discussion on transformations needed to reach the “furthest behind first” as pledged in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.",2,2022-04-01,101,109,108,107,0,0,503,505,0,301,0,https://repository.unescap.org/handle/20.500.12870/4359,1007,"• Acknowledgements

80,0,"The impact of ageing on accessibility, affordability and availability of healthcare services in Asia and the Pacific","The Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development (United Nations, 2015) is a call for “[a] world with equitable and universal access to… health care and social protection, where physical, mental and social well-being are assured”. While some challenges to the meeting of this goal are difficult to predict, and outwith the scope of modelling, a key potential driver of this is the changing age profile of populations.

This paper summarises the likely challenges to the delivery of this goal arising from changes in the age structure of countries in Asia and the Pacific. It then seeks to model the extent to which future healthcare expenditures (HCEs) may vary according to changes in the observable determinants of HCEs.

While modelling is subject to significant uncertainty, we provide scenario estimates of future healthcare expenditures according to variation in the age profile of populations, the extent to which future ageing may be healthier, future gross domestic product (GDP), changes in the age profile of per-capita spending, and population preferences for spending on healthcare.

Our central estimates are that HCEs as a proportion of GDP are likely to increase from around 5.3% to 9.7% by 2060, rising to 13.2% if assumptions regarding future healthy ageing do not hold. For high income countries in the region, this is likely to peak and level off at around 11% of GDP, while for medium income countries this is projected to reach 9.6% by 2060.",5,2022-06-28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,301,0,https://www.unescap.org/kp/2022/impact-ageing-accessibility-affordability-and-availability-healthcare-services-asia-and#,1006,"• ABSTRACT

With its overall purpose being to extend social protection to all, the Action Plan serves as a shared vision, strategy and platform for members and associate members of ESCAP to promote partnerships, peer learning and the sharing of good practices.

At the national level, Governments are called upon, in the framework of the Action Plan, to establish an intermediate target for social protection coverage by 2025 and to then measure progress towards achieving universal coverage by 2030. In order to achieve this objective, 12 measures to be taken at the national level have been laid out.

At the regional level, the ESCAP secretariat should, in the framework of the Action Plan, develop a regional platform to facilitate peer learning and the sharing of good practices. It should also consolidate national experiences on the implementation of the Action Plan into periodic progress reports and provide technical advice and capacity-building upon request.

The present document contains information on measures that have already been taken or that are being taken at the regional level to support the accelerated implementation of the Action Plan. In this regard, the Committee is invited to take note of the measures contained in the present document, to share information on the actions taken at the national level in line with the Action Plan and its 12 measures and to propose how action could be further accelerated at the national level.",2,2022-05-20,101,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,301,0,,1004,"• Introduction
