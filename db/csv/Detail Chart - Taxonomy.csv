If a country already provides non-contributory schemes similar to those simulated, the cost projections do not refer to the additional resources needed to implement the proposed scheme(s) but to the total resources, including those that are already being spent on the existing schemes. The figure also highlights a few of the possible ﬁnancing streams that can make the proposed simulated programmes aﬀordable.
